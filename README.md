# etch-a-sketch

Yet a nother project finished :D
Learned a lot on this one...
Learned a that html has a slider and color picker. I've revisisted some css skills and practised java script... a lot. I tried using as little global variables as possible, still used 3 tho, which ain't that bad.
I'm quite happy with the finished project tho :D
